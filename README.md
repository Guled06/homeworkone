I spaced out the source code, so it would be easy to read when the need arises to change something within the source code.

I changed the <div class="header"> to just <header>. 

I also changed the first <div> underneath the <span> to just a <nav>. The <div> property is non-semantic, and when I changed it to the <nav> because the images containing with this <nav> can easily be accsible. 

On number 39 on the index.html, I changed the <div class="content"> to <main class="content">. This helps the developer understand that all the things within this content class is the main compoments.

I created a main content that have sub-sections within the main content. 

Afterwards, I created a aside content that contains articles within the aside content. 

I refactored the selectors that shared the same property and value into a single selector instead of re-writing the same selectors with the same property and values. By doing this, my style.css was easily readable and organized.
